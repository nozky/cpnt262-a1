# CPNT262 - Assignment-1: classList Toggle


## Logger 

This assignment is just for `classlist toggle` but I added some feature

- Dynamic list using array.
- Dynamic button with delete function to remove itself from the list.
- Ability to save the list on a yourFileName.txt. (Trick maybe? is there anyway proper way doing it?)
- Use of `blob Object `to create sort of link so you can save the file.
